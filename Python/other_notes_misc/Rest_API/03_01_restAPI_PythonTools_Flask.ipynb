    "# REST and Python: Tools of the Trade:\n",
    "- There are 3 popular frameworks in Python that can be used for building REST APIs in Python.\n",
    "- All the examples will be for a similar API that manages a collection of countries.\n",
    "- Each country will have the following fields:\n",
    "  - ``name`` is the name of the country.\n",
    "  - ``capital`` is the capital of the country.\n",
    "  - ``area`` is the area of the country in square kilometers.\n",
    "- The fields name, capital, and area store data about a specific country somewhere in the world.\n",
    "- For the examples below, you’ll store your data in a Python list. However, in the real world, this data is stored in a Database.\n",
    "- The exception to this is the Django REST framework example, which runs off the *SQLite* database that Django creates.\n",
    "- To keep things consistent, we use ``countries`` as the main endpoint for all three frameworks. We also use JSON as the data format for all three frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Flask:\n",
    "- It is a Python microframework used to build web apps and REST APIs.\n",
    "- Flask provides a solid backbone for your applications while leaving many design choices up to you. \n",
    "- Flask’s main job is to handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate function in the application.\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code in this section uses the new Flask 2 syntax. \n",
    "- If you’re running an older version of Flask, then use ``@app.route(\"/countries\")`` instead of ``@app.get(\"/countries\")`` and ``@app.post(\"/countries\")``.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To handle POST requests in older versions of Flask, you’ll also need to add the methods parameter to ``@app.route()``:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ``@app.route(\"/countries\", methods=[\"POST\"])``\n",
    "- This route handles POST requests to ``/countries`` in Flask 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Below is an example Flask application for the REST API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# app.py\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "countries = [\n",
    "    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Thailand\", \"capital\": \"Bangkok\", \"area\": 513120},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Australia\", \"capital\": \"Canberra\", \"area\": 7617930},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Egypt\", \"capital\": \"Cairo\", \"area\": 1010408},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "def _find_next_id():\n",
    "    return max(country[\"id\"] for country in countries) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/countries\")\n",
    "def get_countries():\n",
    "    return jsonify(countries)\n",

    "        country = request.get_json()\n",
    "        country[\"id\"] = _find_next_id()\n",
    "        countries.append(country)\n",
    "        return country, 201\n",
    "    return {\"error\": \"Request must be JSON\"}, 415\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This application defines the API endpoint ``/countries`` to manage the list of countries. It handles two different kinds of requests:\n",
    "  1. GET ``/countries`` returns the list of countries.\n",
    "  2. POST ``/countries`` adds a new country to the list.\n",
    "- Before running this application, we would need to install ``flask`` with pip.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python -m pip install flask\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Once ``flask`` is installed, save the code in a file called ``app.py``. To run this Flask application, you first need to set an environment variable called ``FLASK_APP`` to app.py. This tells Flask which file contains your application.\n",
    "- Run the following command inside the folder that contains app.py:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export FLASK_APP=app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This sets ``FLASK_APP`` to ``app.py`` in the current shell. Optionally, you can set ``FLASK_ENV`` to ``development``, which puts Flask in **debug** mode. Without debug mode, you’d have to restart the server after every change.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export FLASK_ENV=development\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- The above commands work on macOS or Linux. If you’re running this on Windows, then you need to set FLASK_APP and FLASK_ENV like this in the Command Prompt:\n",
    "```Windows Command Prompt\n",
    "C:\\> set FLASK_APP=app.py\n",
    "C:\\> set FLASK_ENV=development\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Now FLASK_APP and FLASK_ENV are set inside the Windows shell.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- With all the environment variables ready, you can now start the Flask development server by calling flask run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "flask run\n",
    "* Serving Flask app \"app.py\" (lazy loading)\n",
    "* Environment: development\n",
    "* Debug mode: on\n",
    "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This starts up a server running the application. Open up your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/countries, and you’ll see the following response:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",

    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This JSON response contains the three countries defined at the start of ``app.py``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's have a code walkthrough:\n",
    "#### 1. get_countries():\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/countries\")\n",
    "def get_countries():\n",
    "    return jsonify(countries)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```@app.get()``` is a Flask decorator to connect GET requests to a function in the application.\n",
    "- When the ``/countries`` is accessed, Flask calls this decorated function to handle the HTTP request and return a response.\n",
    "- Also, ``get_countries()`` is a function which takes in the list ``countries`` and converts it to JSON with ``jsonify()``.\n",
    "- **Note**: In most of the cases, Flask automatically converts Python dictionary to JSON, however, this is only supported for **one single dictionary** at a time and not a list of dictionaries (as in case of our example):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/country\")\n",
    "def get_country():\n",
    "    return countries[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In this case, we return the second dictionary from countries which is automatically converted to JSON by Flask and the response is as below:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"area\": 7617930,\n",
    "    \"capital\": \"Canberra\",\n",
    "    \"id\": 2,\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Australia\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In ``get_countries()``, you need to use ``jsonify()`` because you’re returning a **list of dictionaries** and not just a single dictionary. Flask doesn’t automatically convert lists to JSON!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. add_country():\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/countries\")\n",
    "def add_country():\n",
    "    if request.is_json():\n",
    "        country = request.get_json()\n",
    "        # Adding the id for the new country\n",
    "        country[\"id\"] = _find_next_id()\n",
    "        countries.append(country)\n",
    "        return country, 201                          # Created\n",
    "    return {\"error\": \"Request must be JSON\"}, 415    # Unsupported media type\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This function performs the following operations:\n",
    "    1. Checks if request is JSON -- ``request.is_json()``\n",
    "    2. If True, creates a new ``country`` instance -- ``request.get_json()``\n",
    "    3. Finds the next id to be set for this country and sets it in the JSON -- ``_find_next_id()``\n",
    "    4. Appends the new ``country`` object to ``countries`` -- ``countries.append(country)``\n",
    "    5. Returns the country in response along with the ``201 Created`` status code.\n",
    "    6. If False, Returns an error with ``415 Unsupported Media Type`` status code in case if the media type was not JSON.\n",
    "- ``add_country()`` also calls ``_find_next_id()`` to determine the id for the new country:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _find_next_id():\n",
    "    return max(country[\"id\"] for country in countries) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This ``helper`` function uses a *generator* expression to select all the country IDs and then calls ``max()`` on them to get the largest value. It increments this value by 1 to get the next ID to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trying it out:\n",
    "- We can use ``curl`` to try our endpoints in the shell.\n",
    "- ``curl`` allows us to send HTTP requests from the commmand line.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/countries \\\n",
    "-X POST \\\n",
    "-H 'Content-Type: application.json' \\\n",
    "-d {\"name\":\"Germany\", \"capital\": \"Berlin\", \"area\": 357022}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Below options are used here:\n",
    "    - `-X`: sets the HTTP method for the request\n",
    "    - `-H`: adds the HTTP header to the request\n",
    "    - `-d`: defines the request data\n",
    "- With these options, curl sends JSON data in a ``POST`` request with the ``Content-Type`` header set to ``application/json``. The REST API returns ``201 CREATED`` along with the JSON for the new country you added:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"area\": 357022,\n",
    "    \"capital\": \"Berlin\",\n",
    "    \"id\": 4,\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Germany\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Note:** In this example, ``add_country()`` doesn’t contain any validation to confirm that the JSON in the request matches the format of countries. Check out [flask-expects-json](https://pypi.org/project/flask-expects-json/) if you’d like to validate the format of JSON in Flask.\n",
    "- We can also use ``curl`` to send a ``GET`` request to ``/countries`` and confirm if the new country was added.\n",
    "- If we don't use the ``-x`` option in command line with ``curl``, it sends a ``GET`` request by default:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/countries\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This returns the full list of countries in the system, with the newest country at the bottom:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
