    "# Django REST Framework:\n",
    "- Django REST framework is another popular option for building REST APIs.\n",
    "- It adds the REST API functionality on top of the existing Django project.\n",
    "- To use Django REST framework, we need a Django project to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install and setup Django and Django REST API:\n",
    "- First, install ``Django`` and ``djangorestframework`` with pip:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python -m pip install Django djangorestframework\n",
    "```\n",
    "- We can now use the ``django-admin`` tool to create a new Django project:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "django-admin startproject countryapi\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command creates a new folder in your current directory called ``countryapi``. Inside this folder are all the files you need to run your Django project.\n",
    "- Next, you’re going to create a new **Django application** inside your project. Django breaks up the functionality of a project into **applications**. Each application manages a distinct part of the project.\n",
    "- To create the application, change directories to ``countryapi`` and run the following command:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python manage.py startapp countries\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This creates a new ``countries`` folder inside your project. Inside this folder are the base files for this application.\n",
    "- Once the application is created, we need to tell Django about it. \n",
    "- Alongside the countries folder that we created, is another folder called ``countryapi``. This folder contains **configurations** and **settings** for your project.\n",
    "- **Note:** This folder has the same name as the root folder that Django created when we ran ``django-admin startproject countryapi``.\n",
    "- We need to add the following lines to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to tell Django about the ``countries`` application and Django REST framework (adding ``rest_framework`` and ``countries`` in the list):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countryapi/settings.py\n",
    "INSTALLED_APPS = [\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.admin\",\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.auth\",\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.contenttypes\",\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.sessions\",\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.messages\",\n",
    "    \"django.contrib.staticfiles\",\n",
    "    \"rest_framework\",\n",
    "    \"countries\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Django plugins are Django applications that are packaged up and distributed and that anyone can use and ``rest_framework`` is another such plugin, thus we need to add it before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Create a Django Model:\n",
    "- We need to create a Django model to define the fields of our data. Inside of the countries application, update ``models.py`` with the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countries/models.py\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Country(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    capital = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    area = models.IntegerField(help_text=\"(in square kilometers)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Django will use this model to create the database table and columns for the country data.\n",
    "- To have Django update the database based on this model:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "Migrations for 'countries':\n",
    "  countries/migrations/0001_initial.py\n",
    "    - Create model Country\n",
    "\n",
    "> python manage.py migrate\n",
    "Operations to perform:\n",
    "  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, countries, sessions\n",
    "Running migrations:\n",
    "  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK\n",
    "  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "- These commands use Django migrations to create a new table in the database.\n",
    "- The table is initially empty. But it would be good to have some initial data so that we can test our Django REST framework.\n",
    "- We use **[Django fixture](https://realpython.com/django-pytest-fixtures/)** for this.\n",
    "- We need to create a file ``countries.json`` and have the below data:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"model\": \"countries.country\",\n",
    "        \"pk\": 1,\n",
    "        \"fields\": {\n",
    "            \"name\": \"Thailand\",\n",
    "            \"capital\": \"Bangkok\",\n",
    "            \"area\": 513120\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"model\": \"countries.country\",\n",
    "        \"pk\": 2,\n",
    "        \"fields\": {\n",
    "            \"name\": \"Australia\",\n",
    "            \"capital\": \"Canberra\",\n",
    "            \"area\": 7617930\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"model\": \"countries.country\",\n",
    "        \"pk\": 3,\n",
    "        \"fields\": {\n",
    "            \"name\": \"Egypt\",\n",
    "            \"capital\": \"Cairo\",\n",
    "            \"area\": 1010408\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This JSON contains database entries for three countries. \n",
    "- Calling the following command will load this data in the database and adds 3 rows in the DB:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python manage.py loaddata countries.json\n",
    "Installed 3 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Model Serializers:\n",
    "- Django REST Framework takes an existing Django model and converts it to JSON for REST API.\n",
    "- It does this with **model serializers** which tells Django REST framework how to convert a model instance to JSON and what data to include. \n",
    "- We need to create a serializer for the ``Country`` mode. We will start with creating a file, ``serializers.py`` inside the ``countries`` app with the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countries/serializers.py\n",
    "from rest_framework import serializers\n",
    "from .models import Country\n",
    "\n",
    "class CountrySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Country\n",
    "        fields = [\"id\", \"name\", \"capital\", \"area\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This serializer: ``CountrySerializer()``, is a subclass of class: ``serializer.ModelSerializer`` which automatically generates JSON content based on the model fields of ``Country``. \n",
    "- Unless specified, a ModelSerializer subclass includes all fields from the Django model in the JSON. \n",
    "- Hence, we must specify the list of data we wish to include by setting the ``fields``variable in order to modify this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Create Django views:\n",
    "- As we know, Django uses *views* to query data from the database and display to the user.\n",
    "- Similarly, Django REST framework also makes use of *views*.\n",
    "- However, instead of writing REST API views from scratch, we can subclass Django REST framework’s ``ModelViewSet`` class, which has default views for common REST API operations.\n",
    "- **Note:** The Django REST framework documentation refers to these views as [actions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#viewset-actions).\n",
    "- Here’s a list of the actions that ``ModelViewSet`` provides and their equivalent HTTP methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP Method | Action | Description |\n",
    "| :---------- | :----- | :---------- |\n",
    "| GET | .list() | Get a list of countries. |\n",
    "| GET | .retrieve() | Get a single country. |\n",
    "| POST | .create() | Create a new country. |\n",
    "| PUT | .update() | Update a country. |\n",
    "| PATCH | .partial_update() | Partially update a country. |\n",
    "| DELETE | .destroy() | Delete a country. |\n",
    "\n",
    "- These actions map to the standard HTTP methods as expected in a REST API. \n",
    "- We can override these actions in our subclass or add additional actions based on the requirements.\n",
    "- Below is the code for a ``ModelViewSet`` subclass called ``CountryViewSet``.\n",
    "- This class will generate the views needed to manage ``country`` data.\n",
    "- Just like in case of the ``CountrySerializer`` class, we need to modify the code in ``views.py`` inside the ``countries.py`` file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countries/views.py\n",
    "from rest_framework import viewsets\n",
    "\n",
    "from .models import Country\n",
    "from .serializers import CountrySerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class CountryViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n",
    "    serializer_class = CountrySerializer\n",
    "    queryset = Country.objects.all()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ``serializer_class = CountrySerializer`` tells Django REST framework which serializer to use.\n",
    "- ``queryset = Country.objects.all()`` tells how to query the DB for this specific set of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Update the urls.py locally (for the app):\n",
    "- Once the views are created, we need to map them to the respective endpoints or URLs.\n",
    "- Django REST framework provides a ``DefaultRouter`` that will automatically generate URLs for a ``ModelViewSet``:\n",
    "- We need to Create a ``urls.py`` file in the ``countries`` application and add the following code to the file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countries/urls.py\n",
    "from django.urls import path, include\n",
    "from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter\n",
    "\n",
    "from .views import CountryViewSet\n",
    "\n",
    "router = DefaultRouter()\n",
    "router.register(r\"countries\", CountryViewSet)\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path(\"\", include(router.urls))\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This code creates a ``DefaultRouter`` and registers ``CountryViewSet`` under the ``countries`` URL.\n",
    "- This will place all the URLs for ``CountryViewSet`` under ``/countries/``.\n",
    "- **Note:** Django REST framework automatically appends a forward slash (/) to the end of any endpoints generated by DefaultRouter. We can disable this behavior like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "router = DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This will disable the forward slash at the end of endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Update the urls.py globally (for the project):\n",
    "- Finally, we also need to update the project's base ``urls.py`` file to include all the ``countries`` URLs in the project.\n",
    "- Update the ``urls.py``inside the ``countryapi`` folder:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# countryapi/urls.py\n",
    "from django.contrib import admin\n",
    "from django.urls import path, include\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path(\"admin/\", admin.site.urls),\n",
    "    path(\"\", include(\"countries.urls\")),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Run the application:\n",
    "- Run the following command in the root ``countryapi`` directory to start the Django development server:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python manage.py runserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Once the dev server is running, we can copy the link and send a ``GET`` request to ``/countries/``.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/countries/ -w '\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Django REST framework sends back a JSON response with the three countries we added earlier:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"id\": 1,\n",
    "        \"name\":\"Thailand\",\n",
    "        \"capital\":\"Bangkok\",\n",
    "        \"area\":513120\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"id\": 2,\n",
    "        \"name\":\"Australia\",\n",
    "        \"capital\":\"Canberra\",\n",
    "        \"area\":7617930\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"id\": 3,\n",

    "        \"area\":1010408\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The ``DefaultRouter`` we created in ``countries/urls.py`` provides URLs for requests to all the standard API endpoints:\n",
    "  - GET ``/countries/``\n",
    "  - GET ``/countries/<country_id>/``\n",
    "  - POST ``/countries/``\n",
    "  - PUT ``/countries/<country_id>/``\n",
    "  - PATCH ``/countries/<country_id>/``\n",
    "  - DELETE ``/countries/<country_id>/``\n",
    "- ``POST`` request to ``/countries/`` to a create a new ``Country`` in the Django project:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/countries/ \\\n",
    "-X POST \\\n",
    "-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n",
    "-d '{\"name\":\"Germany\", \"capital\": \"Berlin\", \"area\": 357022}' \\\n",
    "-w '\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This creates a new ``Country`` with the JSON we sent in the request. \n",
    "- Django REST framework returns a ``201 Created`` status code and the new ``Country``:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"id\":4,\n",
    "    \"name\":\"Germany\",\n",
    "    \"capital\":\"Berlin\",\n",
    "    \"area\":357022\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Note:** By default, the response doesn’t include a new line at the end. This means that the JSON may run into your command prompt. The curl command above includes ``-w '\\n'`` to add a newline character after the JSON to fix this issue.\n",
    "- You can view an existing ``Country`` by sending a request to ``GET /countries/<country_id>/`` with an existing id. \n",
    "- Run the following command to get the first ``Country``:\n",
