    "### When to use a while loop:\n",
    "In cases when we do not know until when is a loop supposed to be executed. We term these iterations as indefinite iterations.\n",
    "<br> While loops are often used to create listener functions where a program keeps asking the user for an input until the correct input is received.\n",
    "<br>In other words, the body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to ``True``.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of for loops, we know the number of iterations until when is a particular loop to be executed.\n",
    "<br>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the condition, yielding False or True.\n",
    "2. If the condition is ``False``, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.\n",
    "3. If the condition is ``True``, execute each of the statements in the body and then go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes ``False`` and the loop terminates. If not, the loop would become and **infinite loop**."
