    "# Deep and Shallow Copies:\n",
    "- Earlier, we observed that using the slicing operator [:] would take care of any issues related to copied references (changes in copied list when changes are done in the original list). This is known as aliasing.\n",
    "- However, that is only true for making shallow copies (copying a list at the highest level), but as we get into nested data, and nested lists in particular, the rules become a bit more complicated. \n",
    "- We can have second-level aliasing in these cases, which means we need to make deep copies.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- When a nested list is copied, copies of the internal lists are not deep. i.e., performing a mutation operation on one of the original sublists, will change the copied version as well. "
